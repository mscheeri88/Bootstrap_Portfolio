Bootstrap_Portfolio

In this assignment I was to re-create the portfolio we didn initally using bootstrapping.  I started from scratch with this assignemnt as it was easier then trying to manipulate the existing code as I found after the first half hour or so.  I then psuedo coded my layout, and placed my images and divs.  I found this to be much similar and effective.  Using bootsrapping is a great tool and I believe I have a good handl on how to use it now and going forward.
